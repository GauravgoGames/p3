# CricProAce - Sports Prediction Platform

## Overview

This is a comprehensive cricket prediction platform with tournament management, user verification system, and support ticket functionality. Built with React, TypeScript, Express.js, and PostgreSQL, it features advanced tournament management, user prediction systems with leaderboards, admin verification with badges, and real-time support chat. The application is structured as a full-stack monorepo designed for deployment on Replit.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query) for server state management
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds
- **UI Components**: Comprehensive shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI primitives
- **Features**: Tournament management, match predictions, user leaderboards, admin verification system

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20 with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with connect-pg-simple
- **Authentication**: Custom passport-local strategy with bcrypt hashing
- **File Upload**: Multer for profile images and site assets
- **Real-time**: WebSocket support for live updates

### Data Storage Solutions
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL (configured for Neon Database)
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with TypeScript-first approach
- **Schema Location**: `shared/schema.ts` for type safety across client/server
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for database migrations in `./migrations`
- **Development Storage**: In-memory storage implementation for development (MemStorage class)

## Key Components

### Shared Schema
- **User Model**: Basic user schema with id, username, and password fields
- **Type Safety**: Zod validation schemas generated from Drizzle schema
- **Location**: `shared/schema.ts` - accessible by both client and server

### Storage Interface
- **Interface**: `IStorage` defines CRUD operations
- **Implementation**: `MemStorage` class for in-memory development storage
- **Methods**: `getUser`, `getUserByUsername`, `createUser`
- **Location**: `server/storage.ts`

### Client-Side Components
- **Pages**: Home page with modern Hello World design, 404 Not Found page
- **UI Library**: Complete shadcn/ui component set (50+ components)
- **Styling**: Custom CSS variables for theming, responsive design utilities
- **Hooks**: Custom hooks for mobile detection and toast notifications

### Server-Side Setup
- **Route Registration**: Modular route system in `server/routes.ts`
- **Development Server**: Vite integration for hot module replacement
- **Static Serving**: Production-ready static file serving
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling middleware
- **Logging**: Request/response logging with timing information

## Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**: React components make API calls using React Query
2. **API Routes**: Express.js routes handle requests with `/api` prefix
3. **Storage Layer**: Routes interact with storage interface for data operations
4. **Database Operations**: Drizzle ORM handles database queries (when configured)
5. **Response**: JSON responses sent back to client with proper error handling
6. **State Management**: React Query manages client-side caching and synchronization

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: Serverless PostgreSQL driver for Neon Database
- **drizzle-orm**: TypeScript ORM for database operations
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management for React
- **wouter**: Lightweight client-side routing

### UI Dependencies
- **@radix-ui/***: Primitive UI components (30+ packages)
- **tailwindcss**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **class-variance-authority**: Component variant handling
- **clsx**: Conditional className utility

### Development Tools
- **vite**: Fast build tool and development server
- **tsx**: TypeScript execution for development
- **esbuild**: Fast bundler for production server build

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. **Automated Build**: `./build.sh` script handles complete build process
   - Cleans previous builds (dist/, server/public)
   - Runs Vite to build React app to `dist/public`
   - Runs esbuild to bundle server code to `dist/index.js`
   - Copies frontend assets to `server/public` (server expectation)
2. **Build Command**: `npm run build` executes the build script
3. **Production Ready**: All assets properly positioned for deployment

### Production Configuration
- **Start Command**: `npm run start` or `./start.sh` runs production server
- **Environment**: NODE_ENV=production automatically set
- **Port**: Application runs on port 5000 (0.0.0.0 binding for external access)
- **Database**: Requires DATABASE_URL environment variable for PostgreSQL connection
- **Health Check**: Built-in endpoint at `/` for deployment verification
- **Static Assets**: Served from `server/public` with proper fallback routing

### Development Configuration
- **Dev Command**: `npm run dev` runs development server with hot reload
- **Vite Integration**: Full HMR support for frontend development
- **TypeScript**: Real-time type checking across the entire stack

### Replit Configuration
- **Modules**: nodejs-20, web, postgresql-16
- **Deployment**: Autoscale deployment target
- **Workflows**: Parallel execution with automatic port detection
