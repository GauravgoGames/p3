# CricProAce Deployment Guide

## Fixed Deployment Issues

### 1. Build Process Fixed
- **Issue**: Build output mismatch - Vite builds to `dist/public` but server expects `server/public`
- **Solution**: Created `build.sh` script that:
  - Builds frontend with Vite → `dist/public`
  - Builds backend with esbuild → `dist/index.js`
  - Copies frontend assets to `server/public` (server expectation)

### 2. Static File Serving Fixed
- **Issue**: Production server couldn't find built frontend files
- **Solution**: Build script ensures files are in correct location (`server/public`)
- **Verification**: serveStatic function now finds files and serves them properly

### 3. Health Check Endpoint Added
- **Issue**: Deployment health checks were failing on `/` endpoint
- **Solution**: Added `/api/health` endpoint that returns:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "ok",
    "timestamp": "2025-08-10T14:02:39.510Z",
    "environment": "production"
  }
  ```
- **Note**: Root `/` endpoint also works (serves React app)

### 4. Production Startup Fixed
- **Issue**: No proper production startup verification
- **Solution**: Created `start.sh` script that:
  - Verifies build artifacts exist
  - Runs build if needed
  - Starts production server with proper environment

## Commands for Deployment

### Build Application
```bash
./build.sh
# or
npm run build
```

### Start Production Server
```bash
./start.sh
# or
npm run start
```

### Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
curl http://localhost:5000/  # React app
```

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `build.sh` - Automated build script
- `start.sh` - Production startup script with verification
- `Dockerfile` - Container deployment configuration
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files
- `server/routes.ts` - Added `/api/health` endpoint
- `replit.md` - Updated deployment documentation

## Deployment Verification

✅ Build process works correctly
✅ Frontend assets in correct location (`server/public`)
✅ Backend bundle created (`dist/index.js`)
✅ Health check endpoint responds correctly
✅ Root endpoint serves React application
✅ Production server starts successfully
✅ All API endpoints functional

## Replit Deployment

The application is now ready for Replit deployment with:
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (uses build.sh)
- **Start Command**: `npm run start` 
- **Health Check**: Both `/` and `/api/health` endpoints work
- **Port**: 5000 (correctly bound to 0.0.0.0)
- **Environment**: Production configuration automatic
